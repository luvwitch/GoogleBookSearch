# GoogleBookSearch

## Description

A browser based application which uses a combination of an Atlas mongo_db server and a google search api to search and save books at the touch of a button.

## User Story

As a book lover, I want to search for books I am interested in and save a list of books I'd like to read or purchase.

## Usage

Upon downloading the necessary files, within the console run the command:

```bash
npm i
```
This will begin installing the necessary extra packages needed to run the application. They are already defined within the package.json so git will recognize what needs to be specifically installed, saving the user time it would take to install each package individually. Make sure while running the program this way that mongo is running in the background for database access!

The server and app will be started by using the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```
Once the server is active, the browser will open and the app will be fully functional!


## Demo

The home page of the application looks like this:

![home](https://github.com/luvwitch/GoogleBookSearch/blob/main/client/public/home.png?raw=true)

Selecting any of the books moves them to the "saved books" section.
